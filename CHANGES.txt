0.1.1: (UNRELEASED)
- Added support for ELF symbol type, binding, and visibility
- Added support for symbols with absolute addresses using .set
- Added support for the .zero directive
- Added support for sym-sym symbolic expressions
- Added support for the .uleb128 and .sleb128 directives
- Removed inference of the GOTPCREL symbolic attribute, which cannot be done
  correctly in all cases

0.1.0:
- gtirb-rewriting now requires gtirb 1.10.6.
- Refactored the code that applies modifications to support future changes and
  ease maintenance
- OffsetMapping.__setitem__'s behavior changed when indexing by an element. It
  now behaves as an assignment instead of an update, meaning that it may
  actually shrink the map in some cases. See the docstring for more examples.
- Added support for the .align directive
- The sectionProperties aux data table is now populated when patches add new
  sections.
- Added support for deletions using delete_at
- Functions are no longer needed for insert_at and replace_at. New overloads
  have been added that drop the function parameter and, in the future, the
  old overload will be removed.
- Data blocks can now be targetted with insert_at, replace_at, and delete_at.
- Scratch registers are now passed in the insertion context instead of as
  parameters. This is a breaking change.
- Added support for more ELF symbol variants: GOT, GOTNTPOFF, GOTOFF, GOTTPOFF,
  TPOFF, NTPOFF, DTPOFF, TLSGD, and TLSLD.

0.0.24:
- symbolicExpressionSizes is now populated for expressions in code
- The Assembler class gained an option, allow_undef_symbols, that allows
  undefined symbols to be referenced and implicitly created (referring to
  proxy blocks)
- Added support for indirect branches and calls
- get_or_insert_extern_sym now puts proxies in the module's proxies set
- get_or_insert_extern_sym now populates elfSymbolInfo
- Added a command-line gtirb-rewriting driver

0.0.23:
- Dramatically sped up the time spent applying patches with calls

0.0.22:
- Fixed an issue where running rewriting over leaf functions multiple times
  could cause the red zone to be clobbered on 64-bit ELF
- Updated to new ARM symbolic expression types
- Switched to capstone-gt

0.0.21:
- Added support for symbolic expressions in data.
- Fixed CallPatch redundantly aligning the stack
- Made CallPatch default to aligning the stack and preserving caller-saved
  registers. Clients can opt out of this by specifying align_stack=False and
  preserve_caller_saved_registers=False to CallPatch.

0.0.20:
- Added support for ARM64
- Exposed the Assembler class
- Added ABI.temporary_label_prefix and InsertionContext.temporary_label

0.0.19:
- Added support for the .byte directive
- Added support for printing data blocks with show_block_asm

0.0.18:
- Added support for symbolic expressions with a constant addend

0.0.17:
- Exposed the ABI class, to allow transforms to get information about the
  target
- show_block_asm now prints out symbolic expressions

0.0.16:
- Fixed passing symbols as arguments with CallPatch on 64-bit ELF
- Added a libpath argument to RewritingContext.get_or_insert_extern_symbol
- Fixed incorrect stack padding with CallPatch

0.0.15:
- Added support for rewriting PE-32 GTIRB files

0.0.14:
- Performance improvements when inserting patches that don't contain return
  edges

0.0.13:
- Added a workaround for incomplete Capstone disassembly

0.0.12:
- Fixed a "dictionary changed size during iteration" exception

0.0.11:
- Initial public release
